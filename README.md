Python web API using Flask.

### Running

To run the postgres database and the web app:
  ```sh
   ./run.sh
   ```

The web app can now be reached at http://localhost:5000/

To stop and remove:
  ```sh
   ./stop.sh
   ```
### Notes/To-Do's

I didn't get to implementing unit tests. 

There is additional work that could be done in refactoring the API code to make it more readable and into smaller functions. My next steps would be to do more input validation, both within the console application and the web app.
